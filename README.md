# My DIY accounting app

I produced this code (PHP) 12 years ago, it served as an accounting tool for my small computer business. 
Basicly the app. allowed me creating sales invoices, add new clients to the database, consult goods in stock, store purchase invoices, calculate quarterly VAT balance, extract yearly VAT listing, book cash receipts and even send private messages to my assistent.

My coding was nothing to be proud of, I had no intent to do it according to best practices. It just was top-down programming, aslmost no use of modules, split into files.
