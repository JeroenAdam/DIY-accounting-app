# My DIY accounting app

I produced this code (PHP) 14 years ago, it served as a bookkeeping tool for my small computer business. 
Basically the app allowed me to:
- create sales invoices, manage client records
- create price offers, manage price lists
- book cash receipts, process incoming payments
- store purchase invoices
- store cost invoices
- calculate quarterly VAT balance
- extract yearly VAT listing
- read/send private messages from/to my assistent

This code is nothing to be proud of, I had no intent to do it according to [OOP](https://www.guru99.com/object-oriented-programming.html) principles. It was just declarative programming, split into files.

Disclaimer: this code is old, md5 hashes are no longer secure today.
