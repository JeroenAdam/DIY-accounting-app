# My DIY accounting app

I produced this code (PHP) 13 years ago, it served as an accounting tool for my small computer business. 
Basicly the app allowed me to:
- create sales invoices, add new clients to the database
- create price offers, consult/print price lists
- consult goods in stock
- book cash receipts, proccess incoming payments
- store purchase invoices
- store cost invoices
- calculate quarterly VAT balance
- extract yearly VAT listing
- send private messages to my assistent

This code is nothing to be very proud of, I had no intent to do it according to best practices. It was just top-down programming, aslmost no use of modules, split into files.
