# My DIY accounting app

I produced this code (PHP) 13 years ago, it served as an accounting tool for my small computer business. 
Basicly the app allowed me to:
- create sales invoices, input new clients
- create price offers, input/consult price lists
- book cash receipts, process incoming payments
- store purchase invoices
- store cost invoices
- calculate quarterly VAT balance
- extract yearly VAT listing
- send private messages to my assistent

This code is nothing to be proud of, I had no intent to do it according to best practices. It was just top-down programming, almost no use of functions, split into files.

Disclaimer: this code is old, md5 hashes are no longer secure today.
